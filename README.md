# Calculator

<a href="https://dustydogcodex.github.io/Calculator/"> &#127881; LIVE DEMO &#127881;</a>

This project aims to create an on screen calculator. Users will be able to interact with the calculator through an on screen GUI. Through the GUI, the user will be able to give the calculator a single pair of numbers and perform basic arithmetic operations on it.

Through this project I learned:

1) DOM manipulation to add text to the screen and react to user actions and inputs

2) Working with JavaScript to write functions that can manipulate user entered data and events

3) Working with class constuctors to create objects to store and use user inputed data

4) Using JavaScript to perform actions and then returning the output to the screen and DOM

5) Designing and implementing a web app from scratch.
